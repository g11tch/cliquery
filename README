CLIQuery is a search engine consolidator for the command-line using Bing and WolframAlpha.

A query may return immediate results such as calculations or facts, or a page of search results.

Pages of search results may be followed by entering their corresponding link number.

Flag arguments:
        -s      Returns a page of links from Bing search results
        -f      'Feeling Lucky', opens the top search result in browser
        -o      Open a link directly, must pass url as argument
        -w      Returns data from WolframAlpha

Steps towards setup:
    1. Sign up for a WolframAlpha API key (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html)
    2. Paste the API key in config.txt
        i. API Key allows 2000 WolframAlpha searches monthly
    2. Resolve dependencies:
        i. lxml (pip install lxml)
        ii. iceweasel (apt-get install iceweasel)
            If you are not on Debian you must use another browser that allows
            pages to be opened using cmd-line args, then replace it in CLI_QUERY
