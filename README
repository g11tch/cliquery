CLIQuery is a search engine consolidator for the command-line using Bing and WolframAlpha.

A query may return immediate results such as calculations or facts, or a page of search results.
CLIQuery is the wrapper for bing.py and wolfram.py, controls flow of search results
Arguments passed to CLIQuery are interpreted in bing.py and wolfram.py which communicate results back for further branching or execution.

A current list of arguments:
        -s      Returns a page of search results from Bing
        -f      'Feeling Lucky', opens the top search result in browser
        -o      Opens a link directly through argument list
        -w      Returns results from WolframAlpha

Steps towards setup:
    1. Sign up for a WolframAlpha API key (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html), then create config.txt and paste the key within
        i. API Key allows 2000 WolframAlpha searches monthly
    2. Resolve dependencies:
        i. lxml (pip install lxml)
        ii. iceweasel (apt-get install iceweasel)
            If you are not on Debian you must use another browser that allows
            pages to be opened using cmd-line args, then replace it in CLI_QUERY
