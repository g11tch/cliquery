CLIQuery is a command-line search engine tool which combines the functions of
both Bing and Wolfram|Alpha.

A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.

Link results may be followed by entering the corresponding link number in the
prompt, such as 0 for the top result. The link result page will be returned
to afterwards until a non-integer is entered into the prompt.

If passing -d as an argument, choosing a link will print a description of the
page before returning to the prompt.
If you wish to open a link and override the describe flag, prepend the link num
with o, or open.
Conversely, if you didn't pass in -d and wish to describe a link, prepend the
link num with d, or describe.

Steps towards setup:

    1. Sign up for a Wolfram|Alpha API key (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html)
        i. API Key allows 2000 Wolfram|Alpha searches/month

    2. Enter fields in config.txt as follows
        i. Line one: enter your Wolfram|Alpha API key
        ii. Line two: enter your browser
            a. Example: iceweasel, firefox
            b. Cygwin users should enter 'cygwin' instead
        iii. Example config.txt:
                AP1K3Y-EX5MPL3
