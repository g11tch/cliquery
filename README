CLIQuery is a search engine consolidator for the command-line using Bing and WolframAlpha.

A query may return immediate results such as calculations or facts, or a page of search results.
CLIQuery is the wrapper for bing.py and wolfram.py, controls flow of search results
Arguments passed to CLIQuery are interpreted in bing.py and wolfram.py which communicate results back for further branching or execution.

A current list of arguments:
        -s      Specifies a page of search results to be returned
        -f      'Feeling Lucky', opens the top search result in browser

Steps towards setup:
    1. There is no config file currently, so it is your responsibility to both sign up for a WolframAlpha API key (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) and add it to the api_key variable at the top of wolfram.py
        i. API Key allows 2000 WolframAlpha searches monthly
    2. Resolve dependencies:
        i. scrapy (pip install scrapy)
            Used for parsing XPath's, will be ported to lxml library in future
        ii. iceweasel (apt-get install iceweasel)
            If you are not on Debian you must use another browser that allows
            pages to be opened using cmd-line args, then replace it in CLI_QUERY
