CLIQuery is a command-line search engine tool which combines the functions of
both Bing and Wolfram|Alpha.

A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.

Link results may be followed by entering the corresponding link number in the
prompt, such as 0 for the top result. The link result page will be returned
to afterwards until a non-integer is entered into the prompt.

If passing -d as an argument, choosing a link will print a description of the
page before returning to the prompt.
If you wish to open a link and override the describe flag, prepend the link num
with o, or open.
Conversely, if you didn't pass in -d and wish to describe a link, prepend the
link num with d, or describe.

To open or describe multiple links at once, you may specify a range with - or
enter multiple numbers with a space in between. Leaving one end of the range 
blank will mean go until the end of that range. For example, if given 10 links
and I wish to open the second half, entering 5- would work the same as 5-9.

To open a bookmark use -b flag and the number corresponding to the link in your
.cliqrc, indices start at 1
To save a bookmark edit .cliqrc or enter in the prompt b link_num or
bookmark link_num

Steps towards setup:

    1. Sign up for a Wolfram|Alpha API key (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html)
        i. 2000 Wolfram|Alpha searches/month

    2. Enter API key and browser in .cliqrc
        i. Cygwin users should enter 'cygwin' under browser

    3. Resolve dependencies:
        i. lxml (pip install lxml)
