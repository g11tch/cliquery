CLIQuery is a search engine consolidator for command-line use, combining Bing
and Wolfram|Alpha.

A query may return immediate results such as calculations or facts, or instead a
page of search results comprised of links to follow and short descriptions. 

Links in the search results may be opened by entering their corresponding link 
number, such as 0 for the top result.

Flag arguments:
        -s, --search Returns a page of links from Bing search results
        -f, --first Opens the top (first) Bing search result
        -o, --openurl Open a URL directly by passing it as an argument
        -w, --wolfram Returns query response from Wolfram|Alpha
        -i, --incognito Links will be opened in private browsing mode

Steps towards setup:
    1. Sign up for a Wolfram|Alpha API key (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html)
        i. API Key allows 2000 Wolfram|Alpha searches/month
    2. Enter fields in config.txt as follows
        i. Line one: enter your Wolfram|Alpha API key
        ii. Line two: enter your browser
            a. Examples for Linux users: iceweasel, firefox, chrome
            b. Example for Cygwin users: /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla
