CLIQuery is a command-line search engine tool which combines the functions of
both Bing and Wolfram|Alpha.

A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.

Link results may be followed by entering the corresponding link number in the
prompt, such as 0 for the top result. The link result page will be returned
to afterwards until a non-integer is entered into the prompt.

If describe flag is entered while choosing link results, entering the link
number will print a description of that page before returning to the link result
page. If you wish to open a link and override the describe flag, just enter
o link_num, or open link_num, in the prompt where link_num is the link you wish
to open.
